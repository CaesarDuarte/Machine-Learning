# Hello! Welcome to my Machine Learning repository!

This repository is dedicated to the development of my specific Machine projects. Here I will share my main actions and applications of various machine learning algorithms for problem solving in different tasks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into individual folders, each pertaining to a specific machine learning task. Each folder in turn will contain a folder relating to a specific project, which will have all the necessary files, including datasets, scripts and documentation related to the given project. 

Here is a brief summary of the folders mentioned above:

- classification: Projects involving various classification algorithms.
- clustering: Projects focused on clustering techniques.
- forecasting-and-regression: Projects involving time series forecasting and regression analysis.
- reinforcement-learning: Projects exploring reinforcement learning algorithms.
